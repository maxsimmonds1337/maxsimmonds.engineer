# The Numerically Controlled Oscillator

Recently, I came across the need to generate a sine wave with variable frequency and amplitude. My first "go to method!" was a look up table, or LUT. The LUT didn't feel right, the code was long and messy. For each discrete amplitude change, I had another LUT (which I admit, I should have been able to do some math to fix that but when trying to get it to work, it was clipping and all sorts). Any way, here's the LUTs:

```C
//amplitude reduces in increments of 20%
unsigned int sine_full_5[1024] = {70,70,70,71,71,72,72,72,73,73,74,74,75,75,75,76,76,77,77,78,78,78,79,79,80,80,81,81,81,82,82,83,83,83,84,84,85,85,86,86,86,87,87,88,88,88,89,89,90,90,90,91,91,92,92,93,93,93,94,94,95,95,95,96,96,96,97,97,98,98,98,99,99,100,100,100,101,101,102,102,102,103,103,103,104,104,104,105,105,106,106,106,107,107,107,108,108,108,109,109,110,110,110,111,111,111,112,112,112,113,113,113,114,114,114,115,115,115,116,116,116,116,117,117,117,118,118,118,119,119,119,120,120,120,120,121,121,121,122,122,122,122,123,123,123,123,124,124,124,125,125,125,125,126,126,126,126,127,127,127,127,128,128,128,128,128,129,129,129,129,130,130,130,130,130,131,131,131,131,131,132,132,132,132,132,133,133,133,133,133,133,134,134,134,134,134,134,134,135,135,135,135,135,135,135,136,136,136,136,136,136,136,136,137,137,137,137,137,137,137,137,137,137,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,137,137,137,137,137,137,137,137,137,137,136,136,136,136,136,136,136,136,135,135,135,135,135,135,135,134,134,134,134,134,134,134,133,133,133,133,133,133,132,132,132,132,132,131,131,131,131,131,130,130,130,130,130,129,129,129,129,128,128,128,128,128,127,127,127,127,126,126,126,126,125,125,125,125,124,124,124,123,123,123,123,122,122,122,122,121,121,121,120,120,120,120,119,119,119,118,118,118,117,117,117,116,116,116,116,115,115,115,114,114,114,113,113,113,112,112,112,111,111,111,110,110,110,109,109,108,108,108,107,107,107,106,106,106,105,105,104,104,104,103,103,103,102,102,102,101,101,100,100,100,99,99,98,98,98,97,97,96,96,96,95,95,95,94,94,93,93,93,92,92,91,91,90,90,90,89,89,88,88,88,87,87,86,86,86,85,85,84,84,83,83,83,82,82,81,81,81,80,80,79,79,78,78,78,77,77,76,76,75,75,75,74,74,73,73,72,72,72,71,71,70,70,70,69,69,68,68,67,67,67,66,66,65,65,64,64,64,63,63,62,62,61,61,61,60,60,59,59,58,58,58,57,57,56,56,56,55,55,54,54,53,53,53,52,52,51,51,51,50,50,49,49,49,48,48,47,47,46,46,46,45,45,44,44,44,43,43,43,42,42,41,41,41,40,40,39,39,39,38,38,37,37,37,36,36,36,35,35,35,34,34,33,33,33,32,32,32,31,31,31,30,30,29,29,29,28,28,28,27,27,27,26,26,26,25,25,25,24,24,24,23,23,23,23,22,22,22,21,21,21,20,20,20,19,19,19,19,18,18,18,17,17,17,17,16,16,16,16,15,15,15,14,14,14,14,13,13,13,13,12,12,12,12,11,11,11,11,11,10,10,10,10,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,10,10,10,10,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,12,12,13,13,13,13,14,14,14,14,15,15,15,16,16,16,16,17,17,17,17,18,18,18,19,19,19,19,20,20,20,21,21,21,22,22,22,23,23,23,23,24,24,24,25,25,25,26,26,26,27,27,27,28,28,28,29,29,29,30,30,31,31,31,32,32,32,33,33,33,34,34,35,35,35,36,36,36,37,37,37,38,38,39,39,39,40,40,41,41,41,42,42,43,43,43,44,44,44,45,45,46,46,46,47,47,48,48,49,49,49,50,50,51,51,51,52,52,53,53,53,54,54,55,55,56,56,56,57,57,58,58,58,59,59,60,60,61,61,61,62,62,63,63,64,64,64,65,65,66,66,67,67,67,68,68,69,69};

As you can see, for decent resolution, the length of the LUT get's quite high. Having to have several for different amplitudes is also not great, though, as mentioned, I think that could be changed. Another thing that could be changed to slightly increased coding complexity would be a quarter wave LUT. Since a sine wave is periodic, that is, it repeates, you can utilise this to your advantage. You could repeate every $$ \frac{\pi}}{4} $$ , so long as you initally go through the LUT from the 0th element, up to n, and then go from the nth element down to the 0th, and repeate again, but with negative outputs. This isn't uncommon for applications that are short of memory. Another interesting point is that you can use the same LUT for waves with different phase shifts, by simply having another pointer to the LUT. If you wanted it to be 180 degress out, then you'd place the other pointer in the middle of the LUT. Of course, this phase shift if limited by the length of the LUT. If you only had 4 points, you'd have one coarse sinewave, and only be able to have a minimum phase shift of 90 degrees!

However, given I hadn't done an NCO before, and the fact that it would be easier to adjust the frequency on the fly, along with the peak to peak amplitude, I went with the NCO!

## Theory

To outline how and why this works, let's breakdown the theory. First, we need to understand a little bit about what a phasor is (though, I'm sure you remember from old math lessons!)

The above image shows a phasor of length 1, on what we shall call the complex plane. The x direction are real numbers, and the y are "imaginary". While this may seem a little abstract, it's useful for a whole number of applications, including phasors!

You may have noticed the phasor pointing in a different direction. This is said to have rotated by 90 degrees. In the complex plane, we can say we have multiplied by "i". The explanation for this is as follows. Imagine we have a phasor in the complex plane, x+iy. If x was 1, and y was 0, we would have the graph plotted in the first sequence above. Now, if we are to multiply my 'i' (which has been defined as the square root of minus 1) then we get:

$$ i(x + i \cdot y ) = i \cdot x + i^2 \cdot y $$

We know that:

$$ i = \sqrt-1 $$

$$ i^2 = -1 $$

So, finally, we get:

$$ x \cdot i $$
