# Blog 5 - (More) Schematic Capture!

So, I guess in my previous blog, I lied. I said "over the next few days I'd hope to be done". Well, it's been more than a month and I only did some more of the schematic capture today. But, I guess, it's better than nothing! There's a couple of reasons, firstly, I started a new job so most of my free time has been coding (mostly C, going through the CS50x course, and most recently, GO). Secondly, I've been unwilling to make new posts, as I'm writing some code that auto generates my blog posts. Currently, I have to manually add a blog entry (both in the index, and make the actual post). This is a bit annoying, and I wanted to not do it again until I had written that blog gen code, but that's take me a while too (because of the other things I'm doing!).

So, I put aside my perfectionism and have copied and pasted to make my blog entry!

Any way, I made a small amount of progress, so thought I'd capture that here.

# Progress

Actually, checking back on the last [blog 4](blog4.md) I've made a fair bit of progress, more than I thought! Most of the front page peripherals are done, things like connectors (USB, headers, etc), the "roll to start" circuit is captured, and so is the bluetooth module. I've also done the MCU, and most of the BLDC driver (in fact, if I have any time before I decide to sleep tonight, I might even finish that).
