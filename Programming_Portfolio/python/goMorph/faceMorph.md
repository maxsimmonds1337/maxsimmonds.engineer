# Face Morphing

Face morphing is the process by which you take two faces, and merge them into one. Salient features from both faces are captured, and colours are merged. This post outlines the maths involved to do such a transformation, along with the code, and finally some examples of face morphing - both with human-human morphing, and human-cartoon morphing!
