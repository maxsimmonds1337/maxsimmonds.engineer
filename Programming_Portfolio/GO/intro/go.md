# My First Go At GO!

My wife and I recently had our first child. A lot of concerns and worries arise out of having a baby, and you become hyperfocused on their outputs (wee's, poo's, etc!). So, I wrote this tracking app, that has a go backend that's hosted on GCP. It connects to a mySQL DB (also hosted on GCP) to store data such as outputs, and inputs like breast milk, formula, etc. 

There's a few things I want to add, like websockets for the timers (which currently stop when a phone is used and locked), and alerts for large drops in outputs or inputs.
