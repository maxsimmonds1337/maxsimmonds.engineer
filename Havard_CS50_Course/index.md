# Harvard's CS50 Course

Harvard submits all it's CS50 lectures online, allowing you to follow along and learn as if you were there! They call this distance course "CS50x", and is found on [edX here](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x). What's more, not only can you watch the lectures, you can actually _do_ the exercises, problem sets, and labs, and submit them for checking! All this is done using github code spaces.

A numerically controlled oscillator is a method for generating a value that changes sinusoidally at a given frequency. Usually, sine waves and cosine waves are generated via a lookup table. This is an alternative method that doesn't require a large table of memory.
