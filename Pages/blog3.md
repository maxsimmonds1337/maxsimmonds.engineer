# Blog 3 - VESC 6 MK IV Review

Okay so it's been a busy couply of days (my consultancy has just changed from being a sole trader, to a limitied company, which is exciting, but requires me to open new bank accounts, redo all my consultacy agreements with customers, etc, so a lot of work!) but I have been able to do a first review of the schematic for the VESC 6 MK 5, and it's pretty cool...
